# Code for running the simulations listed in the paper Srinivasan et al., 2023

Follow the 3 steps listed below to run the code for recreating the figures from the figure. All the code is written in R, and requries 
loading 2 code file dependencies.

1. Basic R functions contained within the R_basic_functions library. Run source('startup.R') after loading all the files into a base directory.

2. Now, first run source('circuits0.R') to do the figures for the first model.

3. Second, run source('circuits.R') to do the figures for the second model.
